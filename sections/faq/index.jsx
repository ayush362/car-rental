            " You can find car rental deals by researching online and comparing prices from different rental companies. Websites such as Expedia, Kayak, and Travelocity allow you to compare prices and view available rental options.

        question: "How do I find such low rental car prices?",
        answer:
            " Book in advance: Booking your rental car ahead of time can often result in lower prices. Compare prices from multiple companies: Use websites like Kayak, Expedia, or Travelocity to compare prices from multiple rental car companies. Look for discount codes and coupons: Search for discount codes and coupons that you can use to lower the rental price. Renting from an off-airport location can sometimes result in lower prices.",
